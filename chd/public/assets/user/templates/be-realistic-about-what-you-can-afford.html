                                            <p>This can be paid either annually or in monthly instalments. If you are renting a property on a group tenancy then you will be liable for only one license, however if sharers with individual agreements will need a license for each occupier that owns and uses a TV. If you're renting a room in a private hall, you need to check if you need a TV license for a TV in your living area or bedroom. You're also required to purchase a TV license if you watch live streaming via your PC or laptop.</p>

                                            <h4>Utility bills</h4>
                                            <p>These are payable in a number of ways and it is advisable to check with your landlord/letting agent what exactly they require from you (many will ask for proof of payments before returning your deposit).</p>

                                            <p>Optional. Internet can be highly useful when it comes to coursework and revision, and more importantly, checking your Facebook!</p>

                                            <p>Whilst full–time students are exempt from this, part–time students are not. If you are planning on living with part–time students, you will need to take council tax into consideration.</p>

                                            <p>Optional, but worth thinking about if you're not so keen on housework!</p>
