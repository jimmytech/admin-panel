If you create a lot of moisture in the air in your property it will condense on any cold surface and may cause mould or mildew to appear. Modern double glazed windows are too warm to act as condensers, so the water vapor condenses on the next coldest surface. Mould isn’t nice to look at, may not be good for your health and may damage property.</p>

                                <p> In order to prevent condensation, you need to reduce the amount of moisture in the air, this can be done in a number of ways:</p>
                                <p><strong>Drying clothes: Dry your clothes outside— </strong> it is far eco-friendlier! If that is not possible, then make sure they are being dried in a well ventilated room, so the moisture has somewhere to go, and are spread out on a drying rack and not directly placed on radiators.</p>
                                <p> Ventilation: Make sure extractors are turned on when showering, bathing or cooking and left on for at least 15 minutes after you have finished. It will also help to open a window but remember to close it afterwards. Modern windows can be locked slightly open. Even asleep, you exhale 20 ml of water vapor with every breath! Let us know straight away if an extractor stops working, or you have a problem with a window.</p>

                                <p class="font-italic txt_color_light">Try and keep the temperature of your house constant rather than going from really warm to really cold; this will help stop the water vapor condensing as the air cools. It is also more economic to keep a steady temperature. Use the radiator thermostats to control a room’s temperature.</p>
