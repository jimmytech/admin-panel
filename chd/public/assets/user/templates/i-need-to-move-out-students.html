                                <p>Sometimes things happen and for whatever reason you need to move out of your property. We understand these things happen but your contract is a legally binding document and it means that you cannot just 'move out' and you need to continue to pay your rent. However, there is a way in which you can leave your contract early if you need to.</p> 
                                <p class="txt_color_light">Essentially, you need to find a like for like replacement tenant for yourself, this person will have to match the exact terms of your agreement(including the same level of rent security you have; for example, a UK based guarantor; or if you paid your rent upfront, they will also need to pay upfront).</p>
                                <p>Once you have found a replacement, we can prepare and have signed something called a 'Novation Agreement' which removes your name from the contract and adds the new tenant. There is a charge under the terms of your tenancy agreement of £150 for this (payable once the paperwork is signed). The reason for this charge is that there is quite a lot of administration involved in the process (preparing of contracts, having them signed, credit checking, accounting work, payment processing; all of which is an additional thing only being done as a result of you needing to leave your contract).</p>

                                <p>We can assist by advertising your room for you on our website but it's important to note that you are much more likely to find a replacement as we don't specialize in this service. If we do successfully find a tenant for you there is also a higher charge for processing the Novation, the fee increases to £250. Please note that neither Purple Frog or your Landlord accept any liability if we are unable to source a replacement tenant for you. If you instruct us to advertise your room, we will endeavor to put this online within five working days. If we successfully source a tenant that all parties to the tenancy are happy to accept and this person satisfies all required like for like rental terms and subsequently moves in, Purple Frog take no responsibility for this person during the remaining period of the tenancy and accept no liability for the suitability of the tenant whatsoever.</p> 
                                <p>One important thing to remember whether you're looking for a replacement or we are: everyone on your tenancy agreement will need to approve any replacement and you will ALL need to sign the Novation agreement in order for it to be valid. As such it's important to make sure you sit down with your house mates and explain </p>

There is no guarantee that we will be able to find a replacement tenant for your room, it becomes especially difficult once term has started.
                                You will be required to continue making your rent payments until a replacement tenant is found; if you don't you will incur late payment fees and legal action may be taken against you and your guarantor.</p>

                                <p>Once you've found a replacement tenant and your other housemates are happy with them you'll need to get in touch with your local office to let them know the person’s name, mobile phone number and email address. We'll then prepare the relevant paperwork to be completed. Your obligations don't end until all documentation is completed to your landlord's satisfaction. Remember they must also satisfy the same rental security as yourself (e.g. UK guarantor, pay rent upfront, etc.).Do not hand over your keys to any new tenant until we have confirmed that the paperwork is complete.</p> 
                                <p>Once the paperwork is complete and the new tenant has moved in and you have paid your relevant administration fee, we will arrange your deposit return.the situation to them, chances are they might know someone who wants to move in. </p>
