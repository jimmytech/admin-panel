                                    <p>Though many students choose to live in shared accommodation after completing their first year, private halls are becoming an increasingly popular alternative that often provide additional onsite facilities included as part of the rental agreement.</p>
                                    <p>Purpose built properties are often fitted with the latest in modern appliances and can be a great way to meet new people. Although weekly rent may seem higher, it is worth checking out which bills are included and weigh up the best option for you.</p>
