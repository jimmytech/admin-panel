                                    <p>Your tenancy agreement will provide you with all of the details regarding when your lease comes to an end along with anything else you are required to do. Some landlords/agents may insist that you have the property professionally cleaned before you move out. If you are unsure about anything, speak to your landlord/letting agent or your student union.</p>
                                    <p>If you think there could be a lot of rubbish to dispose of on moving day, try to stagger the amount of waste you put out for collection over a few weeks. Many councils now limit the amount of waste that will be taken per household; organizing private disposal of rubbish can be very costly.</p>
                                    <p>In the weeks building up to moving day, gather as many boxes as possible along with as any other items you feel may be useful for transporting your possessions.</p>
