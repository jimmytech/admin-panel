                                    <p>Living with friends is always a popular choice for second year students â€“ it's cheaper than renting alone, you can split the bills and best of all it's the most fun! Before you begin to look at properties with your friends it's important that you carefully consider which of your friends, if any, would make suitable house/flat mates. Thinking sensibly about your future house/flat mates could help to alleviate any tensions in the future and will help ensure your next year at University is as great as the first!</p>

Though it can be hard telling a friend that you don't want to live with them, it is often much easier than losing the friendship altogether because of lifestyle and personality clashes.
