                                <p>All newly created tenancy agreements, unless otherwise stated, are assured short hold tenancies (AST). This means that a landlord can issue the proper notice in order to regain possession of their property after the period of theinitial fixed term. If the landlord decides to seek possession, he/she must serve notice in writing: verbal notice is no longer sufficient. The landlord can only seek possession during a fixed term of the tenancy if certain legalgrounds stated in the agreement are broken, this is also applicable for the tenant.</p>

                                <p>The landlord has to give notice on a special form called Notice seeking possession of a property let on an Assured Tenancy. The period of notice will vary between two weeks and two months, depending upon the grounds being used. As soon as this notice period expires, the landlord can apply to the court to start proceedings. 
                                Tenants do not have to leave the property until there is court order requiring them to leave.</p>
