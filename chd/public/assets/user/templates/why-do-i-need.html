                                <p>Landlords need a UK-based number since they need to be situated in the UK in order to show tenants around the property and manage the property once a tenant is found. If you are a landlord abroad, and have someone doing viewings for you in the UK, you can supply their number. </p>
                                <p>Tenants need a UK-based number to book a viewing online, as tenants must be in the UK to conduct a viewing. However, you are free to ask the landlord any questions without verifying your number. </p>
