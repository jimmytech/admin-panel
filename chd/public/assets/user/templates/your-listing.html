                                <p>Shortly your listing will appear on some of the UK's leading property websites, a consultant is currently looking over your listing. We will inform you when this has happened. Please check the advertising status box below for more information on when your property can be expected to appear in website searches. Proof of ownership is required as standard for Rightmove - so if this is important to you, we recommend getting this to us sooner rather than later. Our advertising reaches far and wide, so if you don't have this to hand right now, we'll still be reaching a huge number of tenants with your advert, don't worry! Your 5 days on Rightmove will only start when this is provided, so there is no penalty for any delays.</p>                                 
                                <p class="txt_color_light">Prospective tenants can now get in touch with you, and can apply to rent your property using 'Rent Now'.</p>

                                <p>Enants can contact CherryDoor from any of the numerous Websites we advertise you on and via CherryDoor. CherryDoor will handle the admin of phone calls and emails for you - and we'll pass on any tenants who would like a viewing. We call this a "Viewing Request", and their details will be sent by SMS (if between 9am and 9pm) and always by email and on your dashboard.</p> 
                                <p>If a tenant has a question not immediately obvious from your advert their enquiry will be sent using the "Ask Landlord" feature. This will arrive as an email only, and will mask both your email address and that of the tenants. You can simply reply to those emails, and they'll be sent to the tenant - it means you can have a conversation without giving your private contact details away (unless you want to of course).</p>
                                <p class="txt_color_light">We'd encourage you to make sure your advert is clear, and if you have any restrictions / requirements of tenants that this is made clear in the description as well as using our handy tick boxes.</p> 
                                <p>Your phone number will not be made available to tenants; however, we will transfer tenant details to you directly through our central switchboard. When we have a tenant looking to arrange a viewing, we will send you an SMS and email - with out of hours’ enquiries sent to you via email only and available on your dashboard.</p>

We charge tenants £20 per reference required via Rent Now. You can also order references separately for the same price.</p>
